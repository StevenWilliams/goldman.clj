goldman.clj
===========

a small toolchain to fetch stock data &amp; analyze it (future)

`Goldman` is a Clojure library to help you with the following things:

  - Obtain historical stock market data
  - Scan stocks based on technical factors and other inputs

While Goldman is still in it's babysteps we hope to build a small
open source library that helps you identify interesting stocks to invest in.
It's meant to be for curious people eager to explore the stock market in
it's entirety rather than the limited scope a human mind can handle.

Goldman is not meant to support *high frequency trading* but rather
to find a few potential trades with high impact.
